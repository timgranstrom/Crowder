# Crowder
### Concept of Crowder
Crowder will be a platform where you as a user can post content on a wall, where the post can contain things such as images, text, comments and possibly video. The posts are location based where the user can decide where to publish the post (such as, Luleå, Piteå and so on). Each post is visible to anyone looking at the wall in that location. A user can decide himself what location wall he wants to post in, and a user can also decide what location wall to look at.
Default wall will always be based on the users current location.

Users can also subscribe to other users, and can view these users posts as a wall as well.

Each post and comment can be rated good or bad. The rating is anonymous but affects the poster or commenters user-rating.

Posts and comments are self-moderated in the way that if it recieves -7 rating it will be removed from the wall.

Using the users points, a user can use them to purchase site items or features, such as coloring their posts. Purchases and items will not be implemented in the first stage.

Each user is registered and authenticated through facebook using Oauth2.
Each user has his own public profile which contains limited personal information along with all the posts that the user have made, no matter the location.
